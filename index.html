<h2 id="what-is-scrum">What is scrum?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>An agile framework for getting work done and <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">agile</a> is a mindset. Scrum assists you in getting into an agile   mindset by practicing on
            building on the principles in all aspects of your life.</li> 

        <li>It’s a reaction against waterfall therefore it focuses on breaking up work into smaller increments called sprints. This is a 
            continuous process and adaptive to change.</li> 

    </ul>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
    <p>It's a process broken down into sprints that take about 2 weeks and includes 4 ceremonies:</p>

    <h3>Sprint planning</h3>
        <p>  
            The work to be performed (scope) during the current sprint is planned during this meeting by the entire development team. 
            This meeting is led by the scrum master and is where the team decides on the sprint goal.At the end of the planning meeting, 
            every scrum member needs to be clear on what can be delivered in the sprint and how the increment can be delivered.
        </p>
        

    <h3>Daily Scrum or Stand Up</h3>
        <p>Short morning meetings (about 15 mins) to ensure people are aligned with the sprint goal for next 24hrs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What did I do yesterday?</li>
            <li>What do I plan to do today?</li>
            <li>Are there any obstacles?</li>
        </ul>
        

    <h3>Sprint Reviews</h3>
        <p>
            Team gathers to view a demo of, or inspect, the increment at the end of the sprint. Development team forwards the completed
            backlog tasks to stakeholders and teammates for feedback. If not up to scratch the product owner can decide whether or not 
            to release the increment.
        </p>
        

    <h3>Sprint Retrospective</h3>
        <p>
            Documentation of fails and successes in a sprint, a project, people or relationships, tools, or even for certain ceremonies. 
            This helps teams to highlight what needs to be improved for next time.
        </p>

<h2 id="main-scrum-roles">Main scrum roles</h2>
    <h3>Scrum product owner</h3>
        <p>
            They are mainly focused on the business, customer and market requirements for their product then prioritizing the work for
            the engineers based on their understanding. Product managers aren’t always the product owners. P.S there is only one product
            owner per team. 
        </p>

        <p>Effective product owner tasks:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Build and manage the product backlog.</li>
            <li>Closely work with the business and the team to ensure everyone goals are aligned according to the product backlog.</li>
            <li>Give the team clear guidance on which features to deliver next.</li>
            <li>Decide when to ship the product and trying to do it frequently.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Scrum master</h3>
        <p>Lead the scrum within their teams by coaching teams, product owners, and the business on the scrum process, and actively try
        to improve their practice.
        </p>

        </a>


    <h3>Scrum development team</h3> 
        <ul>
            <li>The workforce who see the sustainability of scrum through</li>
            <li>Team is big enough to share 2 pizzas (according to Jeff Bezos)</li>
            <li>Different skillsets but have a ‘we’ attitude thus making sure that no-one becomes a bottleneck by cross training.</li>
            <li>Self-organized and drive the plan for the sprints by forecasting how much work can be completed based on previous data</li>
        </ul>

<h2 id="backlog">Backlog</h2>
    <p>Prioritized list of work for the dev team that stems from the roadmap and its requirements (Two R’s)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Product owner isn’t setting the pace or pushing the dev team. The dev team self-organises by pulling work from 
                    the backlog in an appropriate framework e.g. continually or iterative. </li>
            </ul> 

    <h3>The Two R’s</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A team's roadmap and requirements provide the foundation for the product backlog.</li>
            <li>Roadmap initiatives break down into several epics, and each epic will have several requirements and user stories.</li>
            <dl>
                <dt><li>The product owner then organizes each of the user stories into a single list for the development team depending on:</li></dt>
                    <dd>-Customer priority</dd>
                    <dd>-Urgency of getting feedback</dd>
                    <dd>-Relative implementation difficulty</dd>
                    <dd>-Symbiotic relationships between work items (e.g. B is easier if we do A first)</dd>
            </dl>
            
        </ul>
           

    <h3>Keeping the backlog healthy</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Backlog grooming = Keep it maintained to keep pace with the program by having the product owners review it before each 
                sprint planning to make sure feedback and prioritization is correctly reflected based on the last iteration.</li>
            <li>As it gets bigger it needs to be restructured into near and long term items by the product manager.</li>
        </ul>

<h2 id="scrum-of-scrums">Scrum of Scrums</h2>
        <p>
            Organizations typically use this approach as a first step to scale agile and organize 
            delivery of larger and complex products
        </p>
       <h3>What is SoS?</h3> 
                <p>
                    Scrum of Scrums is a scaled agile technique that offers a way to connect multiple teams who need 
                    to work together to deliver complex solutions.
                </p>
            <h3>The Purpose of SoS?</h3>
                <p>
                    Coordinate smaller, independent teams by having the virtual team participants have links to the
                     originating delivery teams
                </p>
