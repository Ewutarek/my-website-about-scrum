# What is scrum?

- An agile framework for getting work done and agile is a mindset. Scrum assists you in getting into an agile   mindset by practicing on building on the principles in all aspects of your life.

- It’s a reaction against waterfall therefore it focuses on breaking up work into smaller increments called sprints. This is a continuous process and adaptive to change.


# How it works
It's a process broken down into sprints that take about 2 weeks and includes 4 ceremonies:

* ## Sprint planning

The work to be performed (scope) during the current sprint is planned during this meeting by the entire development team. This meeting is led by the scrum master and is where the team decides on the sprint goal.At the end of the planning meeting, every scrum member needs to be clear on what can be delivered in the sprint and how the increment can be delivered.

* ## Daily Scrum or Stand Up

Short morning meetings (about 15 mins) to ensure people are aligned with the sprint goal for next 24hrs:
 - What did I do yesterday?
 - What do I plan to do today?
 - Are there any obstacles?

* ## Sprint Reviews
Team gathers to view a demo of, or inspect, the increment at the end of the sprint. Development team forwards the completed backlog tasks to stakeholders and teammates for feedback. If not up to scratch the product owner can decide whether or not to release the increment.

* ## Sprint Retrospective

Documentation of fails and successes in a sprint, a project, people or relationships, tools, or even for certain ceremonies. This helps teams to highlight what needs to be improved for next time.
